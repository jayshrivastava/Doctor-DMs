What is this?
---
Doctor DMs is the fastest way to get accurate medical information in any situation.

We provide diagnoses and treatments in seconds; no internet connection required. With simple sms queries, we can provide you with life-saving information faster than anyone out there, without any biases or ads, and we present it in an easy to digest way.

It's also **serverless**. This repo contains the separate services we built and deployed with **StdLib**. Currently, our demo is running with sandbox data.

Whether you're in the middle of a medical emergency or you're just sick of waiting for hours at the doctor's office, Doctor DMs is there for you.
